# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This is a repo that contains all the Front-end development exercises done during [Optimum BH](https://github.com/optimumBA) Internship.

Exercises are based on [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## 

Each challenge has its own directory inside `challenges` that contains HTML file, Tailwind CSS config file and input CSS file just like Tailwind Playground does. Directory `public` is for output only and can be ignored.
